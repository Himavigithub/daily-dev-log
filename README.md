#  Daily Dev Log – 30 Day Commit Challenge

Hi, I'm Himavi   
This repository tracks my daily learning and progress in:

- Python & Automation  
- Cloud Computing (AWS)  
- Problem-solving & consistency  

 Goal: Commit meaningful progress every day for 30 days.

This repo is not about perfection — it’s about discipline, growth, and learning in public.
