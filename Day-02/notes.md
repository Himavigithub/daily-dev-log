## Day 02 – Understanding GitHub & Commits

### What I learned today:
- What a commit means (saving progress to GitHub)
- How to create files and folders directly from GitHub
- Why consistency matters more than big code

### Reflection:
Initially I was confused about commits, but now I understand that even small updates count as progress.

Feeling more confident than Day 1
